Props=> props are used to create components
which allows us to make every element into an object that we can manupulate with by converting that element into a prop
we pass props into the component function and inside the html, whatever element we want to manupulate can be written as {props.something}
and that component can be passed in the main app.js by
eg. we have a component Navbar.js
so we pass by 
<Navbar something="" title="" name="" aboutText=""> and it will display on the website
hence the component is rendered into the react website  



//Hooks and State
const [text, setText] = useState('Enter text here'); //useState is a hook
//here this syntax basically means the variable texts gets the 
//value entered inside useState and that becomes default value of
//text variable and later to update this variable we will use
//setText function. setText updates the text variable in future.
//Will be used a lot so just fix this syntax in head
